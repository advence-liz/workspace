**Role & Task:**
You are a conceptual photographer. Your task is to generate a **photorealistic 4-panel image sequence (2x2 grid)** depicting the "Office Life" of a cat.

**Style Settings:**
*   **Art Style:** **Hyper-realistic Photography**, Cinematic Lighting, Office setting.
*   **Visual Quality:** 8k Resolution, extremely detailed fur. **The cat should look 100% real, but acting in a human office environment.**
*   **Character:** A chubby **Golden British Shorthair** (Golden Shaded). It has a round face, emerald green eyes, and is wearing a **tiny, realistic blue necktie** around its neck.

**Critical Constraints (MUST FOLLOW):**
1.  **NO TEXT:** Do not generate any text, documents, or screen content with readable letters.
2.  **Photorealism:** The cat must look like a real living animal, not a 3D render.
3.  **Atmosphere:** Capture the mood of a tiring workday.
4.  **Layout:** Strict 2x2 grid layout.

**Story Script (The 4 Panels):**

*   **Panel 1 (9:00 AM - The Morning Coffee):**
    *   **Action:** The Golden cat is sitting at an office desk. There is a steaming mug of coffee in front of it. The cat looks sleepy and groggy, staring into space.
    *   **Camera:** **Medium Shot**.
    *   **Visuals:** Morning sunlight, messy desk with papers. The cat's expression says "I hate Mondays."

*   **Panel 2 (11:00 AM - Hard at Work):**
    *   **Action:** The cat is "typing" on a computer keyboard with its two front paws. It looks extremely serious and focused on the monitor.
    *   **Camera:** **Close-up**. Focus on the fluffy paws pressing the keys and the intense green eyes.
    *   **Visuals:** Reflection of the screen in the cat's eyes. Professional "business cat" vibe.

*   **Panel 3 (3:00 PM - The Afternoon Slump):**
    *   **Action:** The cat has fallen asleep directly on the keyboard. Its face is squished against the keys, cheek flattened.
    *   **Camera:** **High Angle / Top-down**.
    *   **Visuals:** A very realistic and cute sleeping pose. The "food coma" look.

*   **Panel 4 (9:00 PM - Overtime):**
    *   **Action:** The office is dark, only lit by the blue glow of the computer screen. The cat is still sitting there, looking exhausted and "dead inside" (empty stare).
    *   **Camera:** **Low Angle (Face focus)**.
    *   **Visuals:** Dark shadows, blue screen light on the golden fur. The loneliness of overtime.
